# econference-2019

ECONference report written after the conclusion of ECONference, a panelist event hosted by the Undergraduate Economic Society (UES) on April 16th, 2019. This was the second iteration of ECONference, where industry leaders, graduate students, and undergraduate students share their experiences and wisdom. Students in the Undergraduate Economics community were marketed in a variety of ways for the event, and this report was the first code-driven report created under UES to be published.

Upon registration for the event, students were asked a variety of questions about their academic status, demographic information, and future interests. There are 116 students in this data set.
